                    Organ is a clean and powerful productivity tool designed to help you focus, structure your time, and
                    reduce digital distractions.

                    Whether you're working, studying, managing projects, or simply aiming to stay on track, Organ
                    combines four integrated components into one platform:
                </p>

                <h3>Pomodoro Timer</h3>
                <p>
                    Organ includes a flexible timer system with three modes:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pomodoro mode</strong> – Work in focused 25-minute sessions that count down to zero with
                        an alarm and notification upon completed session.</li>
                    <li><strong>Break mode</strong> – Dedicated timer of 5-minutes that tracks your breaks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Standard timer</strong> – A timer for general time management.</li>
                </ul>
                Each session provides sound notifications and visual feedback when complete. Sessions are automatically
                saved and can be reviewed in your profile.
                </p>

                <h3>Ambient Music Player</h3>
                <p>
                    Set the tone for your work with calming audio tracks. Choose from:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lofi</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>White Noise</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Ocean Waves</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Rain Sounds</strong></li>
                </ul>
                All sounds are looped, controllable via a simple interface, and carefully selected to enhance
                concentration without being distracting.
                </p>

                <h3>Todo List</h3>
                <p>
                    Organ keeps task management simple and intentional. Features include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create, edit, and delete tasks in real time.</li>
                    <li>Mark tasks as completed to track progress.</li>
                    <li>A maximum of 10 active tasks is allowed to encourage focus on each task and avoid overwhelming
                        the user.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Profile Page</h3>
                <p>
                    From your personal profile, you can:
                <ul>
                    <li>View a history of completed Pomodoro sessions (including number and duration).</li>
                    <li>Change your password securely.</li>
                    <li>Delete your account permanently if needed.</li>
                </ul>
                The profile feature supports reflection, privacy, and control over your data and productivity patterns.
                </p>
